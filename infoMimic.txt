TODO
Evaluate database usage in kivy program. Looking for full CRDS example.
    No requirements.txt
    No main.py
    13 Screens/*.kv files. - I think that's a GOOD thing.
    teststuff/serialTest.py run gets "SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'", python2!
    Now "serial.serialutil.SerialException: [Errno 2] could not open port /dev/ttyAMA0: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyAMA0'"
    This probably will be lots of hassle needing special hardware.
